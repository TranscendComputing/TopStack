# Contributing to TopStack

Would you like to contribute something to TopStack? Fantastic? **Here's how you can help.**
Want to hack on Docker? Awesome! Here are instructions to get you started. They are probably not perfect, please let us know if anything feels wrong or incomplete.


## How to report issues & request enhancements

We only accept issues that are bug reports or feature requests. Please ask questions or submit comments in the [forum](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/topstack).
<!-- **Search for existing issues.** We get a lot of duplicate issues, and you'd help us out a lot by first checking if someone else has reported the same issue. Moreover, the issue may have already been resolved with a fix available.
	-->

If you've discovered a bug, feel free to submit directly to [github](https://github.com/TranscendComputing/topstack/issues).

## Contribution Guidelines

### Pull requests are welcome

- Please submit pull requests against the latest `dev` branch for simple merging
- Please keep commits isolated to a single issue

### Discuss your design on the mailing list

We recommend discussing your plans on the [mailing
list](https://groups.google.com/d/forum/topstack)
before starting to code - especially for more ambitious contributions.
This gives other contributors a chance to point you in the right
direction, give feedback on your design, and maybe point out if someone
else is working on the same thing.

### Conventions

Fork the repo and make changes on your fork in a feature branch:

- If it's a bugfix branch, name it 123-name-of-fix where 123 is the number of the
  issue
- If it's a feature branch, create an enhancement issue to announce your
  intentions, and name it 123-something where 123 is the number of the enhancement.

### Key branches

- `master` is the latest production-ready version.
- `dev` is the bleeding-edge version in progress
